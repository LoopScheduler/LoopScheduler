Description:

ParallelGroup p:
    Idler idler
    SequentialGroup s*:
        Worker ws1
        Worker ws2
    Stopper
    Worker wp1*
    Worker wp2*
    Worker wp3*
    Worker wp4*
    Worker wp5

*: Can run more than once per iteration.

Expected behavior:
ws2 can only run after ws1, and the idler thread should be used by other workers when it's idling.
