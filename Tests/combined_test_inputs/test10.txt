Description:

ParallelGroup r:
    Stopper
    Worker wlong
    Worker w1*
    Worker w2*
    ParallelGroup p*:
        Worker w3*
        Worker w4*
        Worker w5*
        Worker w6*
    Stopper

*: Can run more than once per iteration.

Expected behavior:
Unfair distribution between w1-w2 and w3-w6 runs after their first run in an iteration.
This behavior depends on the number of threads too,
because workers are used, not of aworkers.
