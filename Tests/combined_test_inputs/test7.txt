Description:

SequentialGroup r:
    ParallelGroup p1:
        Worker wp11*
        Worker wp12*
    SequentialGroup s:
        Worker ws1
        Worker ws2
    Worker wr1*
    Worker wr2*
    Stopper
    ParallelGroup p2:
        Worker wp2long*
        Worker wp21*
        Worker wp22*

*: Can run more than once per iteration.

Expected behavior:
To test groups as members of SequentialGroup.
wp11 and wp12 can run multiple times per iteration, but shouldn't.
wp21 and wp22 should run multiple times per iteration while waiting for wp2long.
ws1, ws2, wr1 and wr2 run in order and once per iteration.
SequentialGroup waits to start the next iteration.
