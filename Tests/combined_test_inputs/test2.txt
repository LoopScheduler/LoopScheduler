Description:

ParallelGroup p:
    Idler idler
    SequentialGroup s*:
        Worker ws1
        Worker ws2
    Stopper
    Worker wp1*
    Worker wp2*
    Worker wp3

*: Can run more than once per iteration.

Expected behavior:
The SequentialGroup's workers are fast, but they're not run multiple times per iteration,
because SequentialGroup doesn't support that.
