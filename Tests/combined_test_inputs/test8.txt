Description:

ParallelGroup p:
    Worker wlong
    Worker w0
    AWorker aw1*
    AWorker aw2**
    Stopper

*: Can run more than once per iteration.
**: Can run more than once per iteration, 2 times per extra iteration.

Expected behavior:
aw2 to run double the aw1 after the first run in 1 iteration.
Normal workers would run equal times,
because one of them couldn't run 2 times immediately,
and the other thread has to find something to run.
