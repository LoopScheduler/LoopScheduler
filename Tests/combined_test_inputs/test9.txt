Description:

ParallelGroup r:
    Stopper
    Worker wlong
    Worker w1*
    Worker w2*
    ParallelGroup p****:
        Worker w3*
        Worker w4*
        Worker w5*
        Worker w6*
    Stopper

*: Can run more than once per iteration.
****: Can run more than once per iteration, 4 times per extra iteration.

Expected behavior:
Evenly distributed w1-w6 to runs.
