Description:

ParallelGroup r:
    SequentialGroup s*:
        Worker ws1
        Worker ws2
    ParallelGroup p*:
        Worker wp1*
        Worker wp2
    Worker wrlong*
    Worker wr1*
    Worker wr2*
    Worker wr3*
    Worker wr4*
    Stopper

*: Can run more than once per iteration.

Expected behavior:
To test groups as members of ParallelGroup.
wp1 can run multiple times per iteration, wp2 can't.
ws1 and ws2 run in order and once per iteration.
ParallelGroup doesn't wait to start the next iteration.
